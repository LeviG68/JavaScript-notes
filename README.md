# 6 Types - Introduction <a name="Lession 6> Lession 6</a>
* So we have thins such as number, text, true or false. 
* All those this are called types, and what are all the of the different possible options are call JavaScript types.
* The 7 different types in JavaScript are:
  1 String - a string is anytime that you have some text (you will often see that in a single, double or backtick).
  2 Number - a number (regardless of whether it has decimal place in it. Some languages have multiple types to deal with numbers, but JavaScript only has the one).
  3 Object - this is a special one, Everything in JavaScript is an object, and we will understand what that is when doing methods. Everything that we use functions, dates and arrays are just objects at the end of the day. All other types except for objects are referred to as the "primitive types".
  4 Boolean - true or false.
  5 Null - can be used to set a variable to nothing (we will talk more about undefined and null shortly).
  6 undefined - can be used to set a variable to nothing ( we will discuss difference between undefined and null).
  7 Symbol - this is a new one to JavaScript, and it will always give us a guaranteed unique identifier. This is useful for when you are trying to come with a unique identifier inside of an object and you want to make sure are not overwriting something that already exists with that ID.

# 12 Functions Built In <a name="Lession 12"> Lession 12 </a>
* allow us to group a set of statements 
* general related to one another 
* When you pass in data it is called an Argument in a function.
* example --Math.max (10, 12) -- this line is called a statement. Math.max is looking at the two numbers in the parenthesis and evaulated with is the max number.
*  In Math.max(10, 12) the data in the parenthesis are called arguments. Sometimes it will return you data that is the answer.
*  Built in things in JavaScript like console.log, Math.max() and Math.floor(), parseFloat(), Date.now() etc...
